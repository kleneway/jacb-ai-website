        AI is already changing the way software is written and these changes are only going to accelerate over time. We believe that developers, not large corporations, should be at the forefront of this change. JACoB is designed to help developers leverage AI to make their lives easier, to be more productive and to build better software. Our team is committed to building a tool that is open, transparent and respectful of the privacy and security of developers and their code. Every developer in the world should have a say in how AI is used in software development, and JACoB is our contribution to that conversation. We hope you'll join us in building the future of AI in software development, together.
